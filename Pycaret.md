**First, about Pycaret:**
Compared with the other open-source machine learning libraries, PyCaret is an alternate low-code library that can be used to replace hundreds of lines of code with a few lines only. This makes experiments exponentially fast and efficient. PyCaret is essentially a Python wrapper around several machine learning libraries and frameworks, such as scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, spaCy, Optuna, Hyperopt, Ray, and a few more.

**Solving a classification problem with the PyCaret library:**

Install the Pycaret library
```python
!pip install pycaret
```

Read the dataset using the Pandas library:
```python
# importing pandas to read the CSV file
import pandas as pd
# read the data
data_classification = pd.read_csv('datasets/loan_train_data.csv')
# view the top rows of the data
data_classification.head()
```

Initial settings:
1. Import the module
2. Initial setup
```python
import numpy as np

# import the classification module
from pycaret import classification
# setup the environment
classification_setup = classification.setup(data= data_classification, target='Personal Loan')
```
